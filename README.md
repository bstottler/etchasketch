# etchasketch

The Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch Project

This project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The goal of this project is to use skills covered in this course including CSS, html, javascript, and DOM. MY aim for this project is to write clean, readable code that effectively creates an etch-a-sketch of sorts within a web browser.
